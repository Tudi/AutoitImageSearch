- initialize the DLL once in your autoit script
	$dllhandle = DllOpen ( "Release/ImageSearchDLL.dll" )

- Screenshots get cached. Take one screenshot and process it more than once if you can

- Image used for searches get cached for same search parameters ( tolerance and transparency ). Maybe use global transparency color. Use same tolerance for same image
