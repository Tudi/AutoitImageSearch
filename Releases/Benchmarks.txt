Doing benchmarks is not a simple thing. It depends on PC load, it depends on HW instruction set, it depends on build, it depends on integration.....
Because all of this, i'm not even mentioning in what conditions i ran the tests. Numbers should be purely informative just to let you compare if something is faster than other in generic case.
You sould benchmark your specific build / specific image sizes / specific problem to know what is best for you

- "TakeScreenshot()" : 350 FPS at 640k pixels
- "TakeScreenshot()" + "ResizeScreenshot()" : 346 FPS resize 640k pixels to 64k pixels
- "BlurrImage(1)" : 24 FPS at 640k pixels
- "GenerateDiffMap()" : 704 FPS at 640k pixels
- "ErrodeDiffMap(1)" : 66 FPS at 640k pixels
- "ImageSearchOnScreenshot()" : 106 FPS at 640k pixels good case scenario with 2.5k pixels ( 1 match ) - 0.052 FPS at 640k pixels worst case scenario with 2.5k pixels ( image match at every position search all results )
- "IsAnythingChanced()" : 587 FPS at 640k pixels
- "SearchSimilarOnScreenshot()" : 188 FPS at 2.5k pixels. ! does not include setup ( 416 fps )!
- "SearchPiramidOnScreenshot()" : 600 FPS at 2.5k pixels. ! does not include setup ( 151 fps )!
