/**********************************************************************
Mostly experimental image functions for 3D games where objects rotate
The idea was to be able to detect images that have slight rotation or translation compared to the searched image
Comparing edge similarities can give you a Percent based match. X image is more similar than Y
To keep as much as possible of the original image. You should : Edge detect + Color maximize + Binarize

// Remove a pixel if : alone / not part of a straight line

// Might lead to disconnected edges. You might want to combine this with an EdgeConnect
// Radius should be something small. 1 or 2 pixels

//Only keep strong edges. Ditch the rest. This is an image binarization. You should have a grayscale image at this point

// for a better approximation, we could experiment with bleeding edges. 
// Might be slow to generate the bleed map on current image, but the searched image might give a better accuracy sometimes
