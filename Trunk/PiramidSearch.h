// ! Piramid search is unreliable !!! It find bad or no matches even if there are better versions

// The ods that numbers will overflow are :
// if screenshot size is 2024*2024 that is 4096576 pixels. Max sad / pixel is 3*255 => 2024*2024*3*255 = 3133880640
// if we want to compare texture as RS * GS * BS instead RS+GS+BS than we need 93 bits just to be safe.
//number of layers to be generated. Top Layer is 1 to 1
#define MAX_IMAGE_LAYERS			5
//number of pixels to be merged per layer. Ex : 2x2 pixel block becomes 1x1
#define PIXEL_STEPDOWN_LAYER		2
#define MIN_SIZE_FOR_SEARCH			1
#define MAX_INT						0x7FFFFFFF
#define BYTES_AVAILABLE_FOR_DATA	2	
#define MAX_PIXEL_COUNT_IN_PIXEL	( ( 1 << ( 8 * BYTES_AVAILABLE_FOR_DATA ) ) - 1 )
#define RED_LAYER_INDEX				0

// this will force luminosity based search. Search will not be able to distinguish red / green / blue texture at the same luminosity level
#define MERGE_RGB_INTO_R
// !do not panic that SAD will not be 0. Last 2 columns and rows of the small image will be 0 that is why there will always be a difference !
// data locality might improve some search results in some cases
